# What PTREE Is Designed To Do

PTREE’s purpose is not just “draw a tree.”

PTREE is designed to:

## 1) Communicate structure quickly
A PTREE document answers:
- “Where is the important stuff?”
- “How is this repository organized?”
- “What are the boundaries between components?”

## 2) Improve documentation quality
When structure is clear:
- onboarding is faster,
- code review context is easier,
- architecture discussion becomes concrete.

## 3) Be theme- and editor-friendly
PTREE is designed so modern editors can help:
- fold sections,
- highlight semantic differences,
- flag naming inconsistencies,
- provide quick fixes.

This is the difference between a screenshot of a tree and a **language**.

## 4) Enable standardization without locking teams in
PTREE provides:
- an opinionated default,
- a strict “spec” mode,
- and an overrideable configuration model.

Teams can adopt PTREE without rewriting their entire repo naming scheme overnight.

## 5) Create portable “structure artifacts”
A PTREE file is a portable artifact that can move across:
- GitHub issues,
- documentation sites,
- design docs,
- AI prompts,
- release bundles.

PTREE helps structure travel well.

## 6) Stay simple enough to be universal
PTREE intentionally does not become:
- a full metadata database,
- a dependency graph,
- a build system description.

Its job is to represent hierarchy clearly and consistently.
