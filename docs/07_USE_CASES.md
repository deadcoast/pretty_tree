# 07 — Use Cases

PTREE is useful anywhere directory structure is communication.

## Documentation
- project READMEs
- architecture docs
- onboarding guides
- API surface explanations

PTREE turns “where is X?” into a quick visual answer.

## Code review and change communication
PTREE is diff-stable, so it works well in:
- PR descriptions
- release notes
- refactor proposals

## Tickets and support
When reporting issues, a PTREE snippet can show:
- which files exist,
- where configuration is located,
- what submodules are involved.

## AI prompts and context sharing
PTREE is excellent context:
- it is compact,
- it is structured,
- it avoids sending sensitive file contents.

## Template and scaffolding
Projects that ship templates can publish the intended structure as PTREE.

This creates a clear, reviewable contract:
- “this is what the generated project looks like.”

## Education and teaching
PTREE helps students understand:
- project layouts,
- conventions,
- module boundaries.

## When PTREE is not the right tool
PTREE is not ideal when you need:
- full metadata snapshots,
- dependency graphs,
- binary inventories,
- non-hierarchical relationships.
